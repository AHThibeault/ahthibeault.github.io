I am an Electrical Engineer excited about designing electronics and developing technology in the renewable energy sector. I recently completed my Master's of Science in Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering at the University of Colorado, Boulder, with a focus on power electronics and power systems. Currently, I am actively seeking a position in Bend, Oregon, where I can apply my experience and enthusiasm in electrical hardware, particularly in power electronics, PCB design, or IC design.

Within this portfolio, you will find detailed information about the electronics projects I have worked on, as well as my career experience. Please feel free to reach out to me via email, which you can find in the sidebar, if you have any questions or simply to introduce yourself.
