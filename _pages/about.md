I am an Electrical Engineer excited about designing electronics and developing technology in the renewable energy sector. I recently completed my Master's of Science in Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering at University of Colorado, Boulder, with a focus in power electronics and power systems. Currently, I am seeking a position in Bend, Oregon where I can apply my experience and excitement in electrical hardware, specifically in power electronics, PCB design, or IC design. Here you can find details of the electronics projects I have worked on as well as the details of my career experience. Please feel free to reach out at my email in the sidebar with any questions or just to introduce yourself!
