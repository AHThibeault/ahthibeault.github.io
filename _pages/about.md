I am an Electrical Engineer excited about designing and manufacturing electronics to better the world. I recently completed my Master's of Science in Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering at the University of Colorado, Boulder, with a focus on power electronics, PCB design, control systems, and power systems. Currently, I am seeking a position in Oregon or Washington where I can apply my skills and expertise in circuit design and manufacture in a role that challenges and inspires me, and that stokes my creativity and curiosity.

In this portfolio, you will find detailed information about the projects I have worked on, as well as my professional experience. Please feel free to reach out to me via email, which you can find in the side panel, if you have any questions or simply to introduce yourself.
