## Project Introduction

I took the Power Electronics and Photovoltaic Power Systems Laboratory during my final semester at CU Boulder. I worked together with my lab partner Dane Thorne to complete a series of five experiments in which we designed and constructed a three-stage power electronic system for a standalone PV module. The system involved a singular 85 W PV panel that would deliver DC power to a lead-acid battery via a digitally controlled, maximum-power-point-tracking buck converter, along with a system to deliver standard AC mains power from the battery to a load via a analog controlled cascaded boost converter in series with an H-bridge inverter. We designed and constructed the power electronic modules for the system, and demoed our full working system in the End-of-Semester Lab Exposition. My group came in second out of more than ten groups in the Expo for having the second highest efficiency and resultant power output of our system.

Experiments 1 and 2 dealt with characterizing, simulating, and testing the PV-to-battery stage. If you want to skip ahead to the power converter designs, skip ahead to experiments 3 (buck converter), 4 (boost converter), and 5 (inverter). Please note, I frequently include screenshots from my class reports, which will have different font and formatting, in order to streamline this report.

## Experiment 1: PV-to-battery stage characterization and circuit simulation

### Introduction

Experiment 1 involved developing a circuit model for the PV panel from its datasheet characteristics and performing LTspice simulations to determine theoretical operating points of a basic direct transfer scheme and of an open-loop buck converter solution. We also wrote code for the TMS320F28027 Launchpad to generate the PWM signal that would control the buck converter MOSFET switching.

Power from this panel is delivered to a valve-regulated absobent glass mat (VR-AGM) sealed lead-acid battery, intended for deep-discharge solar power system applications. This battery is rated 56 Ah and 12 V, and exhibits the following open-circuit terminal voltages at varying states of charge:

### PV Panel Equivalent Circuit model

The PV panel we used was the Shell PowerMax Ultra SQ-85P PV panel, which consists of 36 series-connected silicon PV cells. This panel is rated at 85W under standard (STD) test conditions (1000 W/m<sup>2</sup> solar irradiance, 25&deg;C cell temperature), giving 8.5% efficiency. At nominal test conditions (800 W/m<sup>2</sup> irradiance, 24.5&deg;C cell temperature), this panel is rated to output 63 W, giving 12.5% efficiency. The datasheet open circuit voltage (V<sub>OC</sub>), short circuit current (I<sub>SC</sub>), and maximum power point voltage (V<sub>MPP</sub>) and current (I<sub>MPP</sub>) under STD test conditions are as follows: V<sub>OC</sub>=22.2V, I<sub>SC</sub>=5.45A, V<sub>MPP</sub>=17.2V, I<sub>MPP</sub>=4.95A.

Parameters corresponding this circuit model for the Shell Powermax panel were calculated using numerical iteration in a MATLAB script. These parameters were found to be as follows: I<sub>D0</sub>=261.23pA, R<sub>S</sub>=13.06mΩ, R<sub>P</sub>=2.36Ω, k<sub>i</sub>=0.00548.
