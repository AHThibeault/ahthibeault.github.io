I took Professor Dragan Maksimovic's Power Electronics and Photovoltaic Power Systems Laboratory during my final semester at CU Boulder. I worked together with my lab partner Dane Thorne to complete a series of five experiments in which we designed and constructed a three-stage power electronic system for a standalone PV module. The system involved a singular 85 W PV panel that would deliver DC power to a lead-acid battery via a digitally controlled, maximum-power-point-tracking buck converter, as well as a system to deliver power from the battery to an AC load (120VRMS, 60Hz sine-wave) via an analog controlled cascaded boost converter in series with an H-bridge inverter. We designed, constructed, and tested the power electronic modules of the system, and demoed our full working system in the End-of-Semester Lab Exposition. My group came in second out of more than ten groups in the Exposition for having the second highest system efficiency and resultant charging power of our system.

Experiments 1 and 2 dealt with characterizing, simulating, and testing the PV-to-battery stage prior to developing the buck converter. They are summarized on the rest of this page. The reports for the power converter design experiments are too long to justify rewriting into markdown, so they are included in all of their gory detail as pdfs here:

# My system on expo day, a success!

With 968 W/m<sup>2</sup> direct normal insolation (about 80 W being delivered from the PV panel), and a 25 W light bulb as an AC load, the battery was charging with 35.3 W.

# Experiment 1: PV-to-battery stage characterization from datasheet specifications and circuit simulation

## Introduction

Experiment 1 involved developing a circuit model for the PV panel from its datasheet characteristics and performing LTspice simulations to determine theoretical operating points of a basic direct transfer scheme and of an open-loop buck converter solution. We also wrote code for the TMS320F28027 Launchpad to generate the PWM signal that would control the buck converter MOSFET switching.

Power from this panel is delivered to a valve-regulated absobent glass mat (VR-AGM) sealed lead-acid battery, intended for deep-discharge solar power system applications. This battery is rated at 56 Ah and 12 V, and exhibits the following open-circuit terminal voltages at varying states of charge (SOC):

## PV Panel Equivalent Circuit model

The PV panel we used was the Shell PowerMax Ultra SQ-85P PV panel, which consists of 36 series-connected silicon PV cells. This panel is rated at 85W under standard (STD) test conditions (1000 W/m<sup>2</sup> solar irradiance, 25&deg;C cell temperature), giving 13.4% efficiency. At nominal test conditions (800 W/m<sup>2</sup> irradiance, 24.5&deg;C cell temperature), this panel is rated to output 63 W, giving 12.5% efficiency. The datasheet open circuit voltage (V<sub>OC</sub>), short circuit current (I<sub>SC</sub>), and maximum power point voltage (V<sub>MPP</sub>) and current (I<sub>MPP</sub>) under STD test conditions are as follows: V<sub>OC</sub>=22.2 V, I<sub>SC</sub>=5.45 A, V<sub>MPP</sub>=17.2 V, I<sub>MPP</sub>=4.95 A.

Parameters corresponding to this circuit model for the Shell Powermax panel were calculated using numerical iteration in a MATLAB script. These parameters were found to be as follows: I<sub>D0</sub>=261.23 pA, R<sub>S</sub>=13.06 mΩ, R<sub>P</sub>=2.36 Ω, k<sub>i</sub>=0.00548.

### Maximum Power Point Simulations

Transient simulations of the buck converter scheme schematic were run at varying solar insolation values with manually updated converter duty cycle to maximize Pbatt. These duty cycle values were chosen by recalculating for duty cycle given the MPP voltage values found from simulation of the standalone system, the buck output voltage (V<sub>batt</sub>=12.55V), and the transfer function for an ideal buck converter, M(D)=D. The average battery current (Ibatt) and power (Pbatt) were measured at each value of Isolar, along with the converter efficiency values (η). The calculated duty cycles and corresponding simulation results are shown below:

## Setting up the TMS320F28027 LaunchPad for PWM generation and A/D conversion

The last part of this experiment involved writing C code for the Launchpad to generate a specified duty cycle at 100kHz switching frequency, as well as to perform A/D conversion on an analog voltage (eventually the sensed output voltage of the buck converter). I am not going to go into the details of that code here.

# Experiment 2: Testing and characterizing the PV panel and DET system

## Introduction

This experiment involved taking our PV panel and battery into the field to ensure nominal operation, to characterize the laboratory panel to find numerical parameters of the equivalent circuit model, and to investigate the effect of partial shading conditions on panel output. We were provided with a 'Mobile PV cart,' a wheeled cart outfitted with the PV panel, battery, an inverter for powering test equipment, and isolated dc-dc converters for powering circuitry.

## Obtaining PV Panel Characteristics

### Obtaining I-V curve at full sun exposure

We tested the panel in the field to obtain an I-V curve at a given level of solar insolation. A rheostat was connected across the output and adjusted to give approximate open-circuit, short-circuit, and maximum power conditions, along with enough data points to form a complete I-V curve. A pyranometer was used to measure the solar insolation at the time of I-V measurement. The resultant curve is shown below, measured at 550 W/m<sup>2</sup> solar insolation.

![full I-V curve](/images/fulliv.png)

The maximum power point at this level of solar insolation was measured at V<sub>MPP</sub>=19.3 V, I<sub>MPP</sub>=2.01 A, giving P<sub>MPP</sub>=38.79 W. This results in an efficiency of 11.2%. This measured efficiency is lower than the theoretical efficiencies calculated at solar insolation values of 1000W/m<sup>2</sup> (13.4% efficient) and 800W/m<sup>2</sup> (12.5% efficient), but this is consistent with the solar panel efficiency decreasing at lower temperatures.

### Obtaining I-V curve with partial shading

The effect of partial shading on the panel and its resultant I-V curve was also investigated. In a panel where all PV cells are connected in series, each cell conducts the same string current. Shading a cell causes it to exhibit a shifted I-V curve, and at the given string current can reverse-bias the cell into breakdown, resulting in large power loss. Including a 'backplane' diode provides an alternate path for the current when one or more of the cells is reverse-biased to reduce the power consumption of those cells. The Shell Powermax panel consists of two sets of 18 cells, each bypassed by a backplane diode as shown below.

![backplane](/images/backplane.png)

Shading enough cells on one side of the panel should forward bias the respective backplane diode, effectively resulting in the panel operating with half the number of cells. The resultant I-V curve with 4 cells shaded on one side of the panel is shown below.

![shaded I-V curve](/images/shadediv.png)

The maximum power point at this level of solar insolation was measured at V<sub>MPP</sub>=8.89V, I<sub>MPP</sub>=1.41A, giving P<sub>MPP</sub>=12.53W. There was likely a shift in the solar insolation during this measurement to result in the power output being less than 1/3 of that with no shading, instead of 1/2, but we did not have access to the pyranometer for this measurement. Regardless, it is evident that one half of the panel is bypassed with this level of shading, and that the backplane diode successfully mitigates reverse-bias voltages being seen at the terminals of the panel.

### Calculating model parameters

As in Experiment 1, we used MPP I and V, V<sub>OC</sub>, and I<sub>SC</sub> to calculate parameters for the equivalent circuit model of the PV panel, for use in LTSpice simulation. We again used our MATLAB script and redetermined the model parameters as follows: I<sub>D0</sub>=139pA, R<sub>S</sub>=13.0mΩ, R<sub>P</sub>=2.07Ω, k<sub>i</sub>=0.00460. Our experimental model results, run in LTSpice at 550 W/m<sup>2</sup> irradiance, resulted in an I-V curve that closely matched our measured results around the MPP and at higher voltages approaching OC, but that diverged slightly from our results at lower voltages. The comparison is shown below, with measured results shown in blue and LTSpice simulated results shown in orange:

![experimental model results](/images/expmodelresults.png)

A similar simulation was run including the backplane diodes in the simulation and forcing the current through one set of cells to zero. The simulated results once again closely matched our measured data points as shown below, with simulated results in grey and measured results in blue.

![shaded experimental model results](/images/shadedexpmodelresults.png)

In both of these scenarios we measured lower short circuit currents than MPP currents, which is not expected for the characteristics of a PV panel. We believe that this discrepancy was due to varying solar insolation over the course of our measurements, as clouds were moving across the sun during our measurements.

## The Case for a Buck Converter

### Direct Energy Transfer Charging

The PV panel output was connected to the battery terminals through a series diode, in order to demonstrate the operating point for a direct energy transfer (DET) scheme. With this scheme, the panel voltage was measured to be 13.1V, and panel current to be 2.46A, for a power output of 32.25W. Considering the same solar insolation, it is clear that the panel is not operating at its maximum power point (19.3V, 2.01A, 38.79W) with this setup, and thus is not delivering that maximum possible power to the battery.

### How a Buck Converter could improve the situation

Including a buck converter between the PV panel and the battery would allow us to operate the panel at its maximum power point while matching the battery voltage at the output of the buck converter. With a high efficiency buck converter, the maximum power point panel power and roughly fixed battery voltage would result in an increase in the current charging the battery. A buck converter, which is only capable of stepping down voltage, should be sufficient for our purposes here, as the maximum power point voltage of the panel at all levels of solar insolation (~16-17V) will always be greater than the voltage range of the battery at different SOCs (10-13V). A MPP tracking mechanism can be included to adjust the duty cycle of the buck converter to follow the MPP under changing irradiance, shading, temperature, and battery SOC conditions, which will maximize the power being delivered to the battery.

### Preliminary specifications for the buck converter

The converter input should be able to operate in the range 0V<=V<sub>in</sub><=24V, 0A<=I<sub>in</sub><=6A. Values slightly higher than the STD conditions V<sub>OC</sub> and I<sub>SC</sub> were chosen to give the system flexibility for operating at higher irradiances than 1000 W/m<sup>2</sup>.

The converter output should operate in the range 10V<=V<sub>out</sub><=14V, slighly outside of the expected minimum and maximum battery voltages. The maximum output current would appear at MPP operation of the panel and the minimum possible battery voltage. Assuming a maximum power output of the panel of 100W, 100% converter efficiency, and battery voltage at 10V, the maximum output current would be 10A (0A<=I<sub>out</sub><=10A).

The converter switching frequency will be set at 100 kHz as a ballpark starting point. A switching frequency that is too high will increase the switching losses, while one that is too low will require larger components for the output LC filter of the converter.

The converter should operate at a peak efficiency of around 95%.
