I am working on building the [Sound Lab Mini-Synth](http://musicfromouterspace.com/index.php?CATPARTNO=SLMS001PCB&PROJARG=SOUNDLABMINISYNTH%2Fpage1.html&MAINTAB=SYNTHDIY&SONGID=NONE&VPW=1814&VPH=882), an analog synthesizer designed by Ray Wilson, detailed on his Synth-DIY webpage [Music From Outer Space](http://musicfromouterspace.com). I became interested in this project earlier this year while playing around with one of my friend's analog synthesizers, and realizing that I could probably make my own. For this project, I'll generally be following Ray's design to gain a good understanding of the different modules involved in a synthesizer. I'll also eventually be building the Sound Lab Guitar Trigger to be able to run the Sound Lab as a guitar effects box. I hope to produce my own synth design if everything goes well with this one.

I am currently working on designing the board layout in KiCAD.
